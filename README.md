## Project Description
This portfolio website is created to showcase my skills, experience, and projects using **HTML**, **jQuery**, and **CSS**. I have chosen to build this website without using any frameworks (such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) to focus on enhancing my core understanding of web development fundamentals. By working from scratch, I have gained a deeper understanding of how each component of a webpage functions and interacts with each other.

## Why I Chose This Approach
Building the portfolio without relying on any frameworks allows me to:
- Strengthen my foundation in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **jQuery**.
- Understand the underlying mechanics of responsive design and layout building.
- Implement custom solutions that align with my personal design choices.
- Improve my problem-solving skills when creating functionality and styling from the ground up.
